# SQL Data Analysis and Database Design
In this project, I used a dataset from Kaggle on Hotel Booking Demand to simulate a real-world data analytics workflow (to the best of my ability). From the dataset, I designed a normalized relational database to minimize redundancy. I intentionally introduced random "messiness" using Python, such as NULL values, text inconsistencies, and data entry errors, to reflect real-life data more closely. 

I then cleaned the raw data and extracted business-relevant metrics through SQL. Connecting this information and insights, I created recommendations to better guide decision making. 

_Note: this project is still in progress_

## Dataset Description
This dataset from Kaggle contains hotel bookings across two hotels from 2015 to 2017. It contains over 100,000 rows of data and includes relevant booking information (room assignment, meal, number of guests, distribution channel, etc.) and anonymized customer data (name, country of origin, email, etc.) Note that all sensitive information has been replaced with artificial data by the uploader on Kaggle.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas) - _introducing "messiness"_
- SQL - _data cleaning, aggregations, extracting key business metrics_
- Jupyter Notebook - _process documentation and SQL queries_
- Lucidchart - _database diagram creation (ERD and schema)_
