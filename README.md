# SQL Data Analysis and Database Design
In this project, I used a dataset from Kaggle on Hotel Booking Demand to design and implement a normalized relational database. I developed an ETL pipeline that extracted and loaded the raw data into staging tables, transformed it into clean dimension tables, and created a fact table representing the hotel reservations.

Finally, I wrote SQL queries to calculate business-relevant metrics, demonstrating how the database can support data analysis and decision making. 

Detailed documentation on my database design decisions and transformation rules can be viewed in my portfolio website [SQL Database Design and ETL
